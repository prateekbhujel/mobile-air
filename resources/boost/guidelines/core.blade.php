## NativePHP Mobile

- NativePHP Mobile is a Laravel package for building native iOS and Android apps using PHP and native UI components. It runs a full PHP runtime directly on the device with SQLite — no web server required.
- Documentation: `https://nativephp.com/docs/mobile/3/**`
- IMPORTANT: Always activate the `nativephp-mobile` skill every time you work on any NativePHP functionality.

### Build Commands — Tell the User, Never Run

**CRITICAL: Never execute any of these commands yourself. Always instruct the user to run them manually in their terminal.**

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `npm run build -- --mode=ios` | Build frontend assets for iOS |
| `npm run build -- --mode=android` | Build frontend assets for Android |
| `php artisan native:run ios` | Compile and run on iOS simulator/device |
| `php artisan native:run android` | Compile and run on Android emulator/device |
| `php artisan native:run ios --watch` | Build, deploy, then start hot reload — all in one |
| `php artisan native:watch` | Hot reload (watch for file changes) |
| `php artisan native:open` | Open project in Xcode or Android Studio |

**Always ask which platform before giving any build or run command.** If the user hasn't specified iOS or Android, ask: "Which platform do you want to build/test on — iOS or Android?" Never assume a platform.

When the platform is confirmed, give the relevant command(s) above and tell the user to run it in their terminal. Do not run it yourself.
